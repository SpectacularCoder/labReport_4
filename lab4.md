### Reporforming the Challenge Tasks From Lab (Steps 4-9)

### Step 4 Log into ieng6

**Keys Pressed:** 
```
# code block 
ssh cs15lwi23akf@ieng6.ucsd.edu 
```

**Summary:** For this particular step I simply just typed out cs15lwi23kakf@ieng6.ucsd.edu to log in. I did not really utilize any special keys as I had not done the this command yet so the up key would not yield this as a past command. 

### Step 5 Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account

**Keys Pressed:**
```
# Keys Pressed
<up><ctrl><v>git@github.com:SpectacularCoder/lab7.git
```
  
**Summary:** 
I pressed up, because before I completed this cloning step I messed up my git clone. However, because of this I can simply use the up key as now the git clone command is saved in my history. With this, I press ctrl v to paste the ssh link to start the cloning process.

***Why Use SSH link?***

The setup for ssh is already done so I used the ssh link. This is made possible because in Week 7 Lab, we generated a SSH github key that we attached into out gitHub account. This will essentially make the process of pushing and committing a lot eaiser than doing it in regular clone setting without the use of a ssh key.

### Step 6 Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
